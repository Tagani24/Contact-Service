1. To ensure that code, programs, or software are functional and secure, a combination of practices is essential. Regular code reviews within a collaborative team environment help identify issues and improve overall code quality. 
The implementation of automated testing, including unit tests and security audits, allows for early detection of vulnerabilities and ensures robust functionality. Maintaining comprehensive documentation aids in understanding and utilizing the software securely.
Keeping dependencies up-to-date and scheduling regular updates are crucial for addressing evolving security threats. Overall, a holistic approach involving collaboration, testing, documentation, and maintenance contributes to both functionality and security.

2. Interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program requires effective communication and engagement with stakeholders. Techniques such as interviews, surveys, and workshops help gather user feedback, and creating user stories aids in
prioritizing requirements. Prototyping and usability testing allow for visualization and validation of software features, enabling adjustments based on user input. An iterative development approach, combined with continuous reviews and adaptations,
ensures that the software aligns with changing user requirements.

3. Approaching software design involves a thorough understanding of both functional and non-functional requirements through requirements analysis. Adopting a modular design approach facilitates code management and scalability.
he application of design patterns, such as MVC, helps address common design challenges. Consideration of scalability, performance, and flexibility for future changes is crucial in designing robust software. Comprehensive documentation of the software design,
including architecture diagrams and guidelines for developers, enhances clarity and maintainability. The integration of these design practices contributes to the creation of effective and adaptable software systems.
